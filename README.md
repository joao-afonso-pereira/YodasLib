# YODAS Utils (YodasLib)

Utils for the development of data science projects. The repository works as a Python package than should be used to ensure methods standardization.

## Installation

The package was only tested for Python 3, so there is no guarantee that it works with Python 2.


<details>
    <summary><b>[OPTIONAL] Create a virtual environment before the installation</b></summary>

  
##### Windows
1 - Go to the project folder and open a Command Prompt

2 - Run the following command to create the virtual environment
```bash 
virtualenv <name of the virtual environment> 
```

3 - Activate the virtual environment with the following command (always in the creation folder)
```bash 
<name of virtual environment>\Scripts\activate.bat
```

##### Ubuntu
1 - Enter as root with the following command
```bash 
sudo -i
```  

2 - Go to the project folder and run the following command to create the virtual environment
```bash 
python3 -m venv <name of virtual environment>
```

3 - Activate the virtual environment with the following command (always in the creation folder)
```bash 
source <name of virtual environment>/bin/activate
```

### Install the package with pip in your personal computer
```bash 
pip install git+https://github.com/joao-afonso-pereira/YodasLib.git
```

### Usage example
```python 
import YODAS.DarkCorridors import LightManager

# Necessary data:
#  - City grid with the following columns: zone, geometry, animal_score, human_score, contains_cluster, nearest_cluster, cluster_score
#  - GeoJSON with city map
#  - CSV with city's street lights

optimization_df = pd.read_csv('y0.csv') # City grid
optimization_df.rename(columns = {'Unnamed: 0': 'zone'}, inplace = True)
optimization_df.geometry = gpd.GeoSeries.from_wkt(optimization_df.geometry)
optimization_df = gpd.GeoDataFrame(optimization_df, geometry='geometry')

city_map = 'https://martinjc.github.io/UK-GeoJSON/json/eng/wpc_by_lad/topo_E06000023.json' # Path to geojson with city map
street_lights = 'streetlights_2022.csv' # Path to CSV with street lights

manager = LightManager(optimization_df, city_map, street_lights)
clusters = manager.plot_clusters()

manager.load('cost_matrix_y0.csv')

paths = manager.find_cluster_paths()
corridors = manager.create_dark_corridors()
new_lights = manager.update_lighting()
```
